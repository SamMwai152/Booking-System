                    The migration is a cyclical event, with the herds moving in a clockwise direction around the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. The timing of the migration varies from year to year, depending on the rainfall patterns. However, the general pattern is as follows:

January to March: The herds are concentrated in the southern Serengeti, where they give birth to their calves.
April to June: The herds move north towards the Mara River, where they cross into Kenya.
July to September: The herds graze in the Masai Mara, enjoying the lush grasslands.
October to December: The herds return to the southern Serengeti, completing the cycle.
The migration is a dangerous journey, with predators such as lions, cheetahs, and crocodiles lurking at every turn. However, the wildebeest are well adapted to the challenges of the migration, and their numbers continue to grow.

The Great Migration is a truly awe-inspiring spectacle, and it is no wonder that it attracts thousands of tourists every year. If you are lucky enough to witness the migration firsthand, you will never forget the experience.
